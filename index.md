Vpedals will let you add delay, reverb, and distortion to any sound in real time. You can also draw an area on your camera feed that will toggle the effect on or off when your foot enters and leaves the area. VPedals acts like a normal pedal, but can fit in your pocket and save you the hassle of broken pedals, power cords, and patch cords. You can also record your effected sounds and save them to your device or share them with your friends.

### FAQ:

1. Orienting your phone: An easy way to setup your device is to put it on the edge of a chair or table with the screen facing up. The device's camera will be watching the floor and detecting your foot movements.

2. Drawing pedals: Tap 3 or more points anywhere on your camera feed to create an area that detects foot movements.

3. Toggling pedals: Move your foot quickly in and out of a pedal area to toggle an effect on or off.
